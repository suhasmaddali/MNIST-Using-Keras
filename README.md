# MNIST Using Keras

Data is key to using different machine learning models for predictions. Understanding and using the basic data would ensure that we are going to complex data in the future that is real-time and this ensures that we are getting the best machine learning models for prediction respectively. 

We would now be working with MNIST data and we are going to be using it to understand the machine learning and deep learning models and their performance respectively. Performing feature analysis, we are going to take some important features and standarize them so that they could be better used for machine learning purposes.

It is important that the deep learning models perform well not just on the training data but also on the cross validation and the test data respectively. We are going to use a separate function that would help us to plot the output values and see how well the deep learning model is performing not just on the training set but also on the cross validation data respectively. If the model is overfitting, we can see that as the number of epochs increases, there would be a decrease in the error of the training output and there would be a increase in the error of the cross validation output and vice-versa. Therefore, we have to ensure that hte model does well on just on the training data but also on the cross-validation data respectively.
