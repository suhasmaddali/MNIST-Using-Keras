# MNIST Using Keras

Data is key to using different machine learning models for predictions. Understanding and using the basic data would ensure that we are going to complex data in the future that is real-time and this ensure that we are getting the best machine learnign models for prediction respectively. We are going to use the different mahcine learning models and this is the time that we are gong to use in the long term.
